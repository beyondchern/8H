          I sense a slight agitation in the air. All small little strange camera problems brought me back to the darkroom.<br>

          “爺爺民國11年11月5日生, 奶奶民國11年9月25日生….爺爺兩年前走了.”<br>
          <br>
          “你爺爺, 奶奶念日文到高中, 早期在日本人開的公司當翻譯.”<br>

          Mother released new information about my grandfather’s death two years after my grandfather passed away.<br>
          <br>
          I didn’t know what to do with or how I was supposed to feel about the news. I read through history books to piece together what it was like in Taiwan in 1922 - the year my grandparents were born.<br>
          <br>
          05/31/20<br>
          “City Wide Curfew 6 PM to 6 AM” - public safety alert popped up on my phone.<br>

          It’s time.<br>

          Sitting, thinking, translating and emailing at a kitchen table with a laptop. Sometimes looking up to see the window. Sunny.<br>

          Still sitting with a laptop. Just wondering about the difference between ‘a time’ and ‘the time’ in our life. Which moment is significant enough to be given ‘the’? Which moment is buried and forgotten amongst many many other small moments? If I am correct, my grandmother is currently 98 and was born also in 1922.<br>
          <br>
          For almost two months, I have been sharing a 13 square meters room with another person. In this one room, we work, sleep, exercise, cook, and eat. On a single, A0 size table, we work and dine. All the everyday events happen in one  shared room means that before and after any action, there are space transformations: things are stored away (laptops, bowls from the table; mattress, standing lamp, stove from the floor); table/ floor is cleaned up; the things for the coming events are taken out and placed, and after the event, things are stored away again. The transition from one activity to another becomes an event in itself. The need to transform spaces for another event to take place also means there needs to be more or less a wrap up in every action-in-progress. When there is not enough space, we create space in the form of time slots – spaces in the flow. Therefore, there’s no room for “go away” from what you are doing and “come back” to it later.
