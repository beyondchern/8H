          05/01/19<br>
          I sense a slight agitation in the air. All small little strange camera problems brought me back to the darkroom.<br>

          05/28/20<br>
          “爺爺民國11年11月5日生, 奶奶民國11年9月25日生….爺爺兩年前走了.”<br>
            <br>
          “你爺爺, 奶奶念日文到高中, 早期在日本人開的公司當翻譯.”<br>

          Mother released new information about my grandfather’s death two years after my grandfather passed away.<br>
           <br>
          I didn’t know what to do with or how I was supposed to feel about the news. I read through history books to piece together what it was like in Taiwan in 1922 - the year my grandparents were born.<br>
          <br>
          05/31/20<br>
          “City Wide Curfew 6 PM to 6 AM” - public safety alert popped up on my phone.<br>

          Sitting, thinking, translating and emailing at a kitchen table with a laptop. Sometimes looking up to see the window. Sunny.<br>

          Still sitting with a laptop. Just wondering about the difference between ‘a time’ and ‘the time’ in our life. Which moment is significant enough to be given ‘the’? Which moment is buried and forgotten amongst many many other small moments? If I am correct, my grandmother is currently 98 and was born also in 1922.<br>
          <br>
          For almost two months, I have been sharing a 13 square meters room with another person. In this one room, we work, sleep, exercise, cook, and eat. On a single, A0 size table, we work and dine. All the everyday events happen in one  shared room means that before and after any action, there are space transformations: things are stored away (laptops, bowls from the table; mattress, standing lamp, stove from the floor); table/ floor is cleaned up; the things for the coming events are taken out and placed, and after the event, things are stored away again. The transition from one activity to another becomes an event in itself. The need to transform spaces for another event to take place also means there needs to be more or less a wrap up in every action-in-progress. When there is not enough space, we create space in the form of time slots – spaces in the flow. Therefore, there’s no room for “go away” from what you are doing and “come back” to it later<br>

          Sitting, thinking and emailing at a kitchen table with a laptop. Received one auto response and one event reminder.

          Due to the vintage status of the camera I was using (used to be belonging to my father-in-law
          and now to my husband), sometimes I came across difficulties in dealing with its shutter. Constant negotiation
          with the stubborn, temperamental old machine. Sometimes stiff, sometimes blank-ish response. Almost the machine
          resisted me attaining a memory.

          The memory machine // Sitting on, dreaming on, crying into those pillows. The mattress
          absorbed the weight of my twenty years.

          The calendar, one of those you remove a leaf per day, has never been finished // Event reminder
          // it was the year of my first relationship// Temperamental old machine// now it’s a pile of
          blank paper for doodling and trying if a pen still works.

          “Camera is just a dumb machine.” VM used to say. Yet, she taught me everything about art and life with
          this dumb machine. I will not trade the experience for anything. My only regret is that after I learn
          the secrets of photography, the weight of knowing prevents me from taking pictures for my own family.

          This camera I used is older than me from an unknown owner. That is fine, now we belong to each other.
          You became my eyes; in exchange I gave up my memory.

For you, it would be nothing but an indifferent picture, one of the thousand manifestations of the "ordinary"; it cannot in anyway constitute the visible object of a science; it cannot establish an way objectivity, in the positive sense of the term; at most it would interest your studium: period, clothes, photogeny; but in it, for you, no wound."<br>

            Two invitations came through. One is to subscribe to an online art journal.
            The other to write a review about a hotel I stayed at a week before.
            Subscribed the journal and ignored the review writing.

            We stopped at a shop and bought a bag of three onions and a box of white button mushrooms.
            The bag says that these onions came from New Zealand.
            The box says that these mushrooms came from East Lothian in Scotland.
            But where did they really come from? Which soil did they inhabit and make constant
            evolutionary relationships with bacterias?


            I check, expecting further information.
            But the expected doesn’t come, only more news from nowhere*.
